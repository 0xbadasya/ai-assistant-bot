# 🤖 AI Assistant Telegram Bot

A personal Telegram bot powered by GPT-3.5 that helps you plan your day, manage tasks, add events to Google Calendar, analyze activity, and more.

## 💬 About this project

I originally built this bot for myself — to simplify daily planning, task management, and quickly interact with GPT in Telegram. It makes my workflow way easier, and I’ve decided to share it as open-source so anyone can use it, improve it, or turn it into something even better.

The bot is currently designed for **a single user** and isn't yet deployed to a public server — it runs locally.  
There’s no external API for task storage, but the **PostgreSQL schema is clean and production-ready** (see the Prisma migration files).

> It’s not a full multi-user SaaS yet — but it’s a solid starting point for one.

If you plan to use it commercially (e.g., launch a paid subscription), I’d really appreciate a mention or credit. That’d mean a lot ❤️
